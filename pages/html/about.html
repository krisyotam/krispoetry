                <p>My journey into poetry started in childhood, when I first discovered the magic of words. Initially, it was just a hobby, but over time, it became a profound way for me to express myself...</p>

                <p>My journey as a poet has been a long and evolving process. Here is a brief timeline of my development:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2005:</strong> First poem written at age 12.</li>
                    <li><strong>2010:</strong> Began studying classical poetry forms, including sonnets and blank verse.</li>
                    <li><strong>2015:</strong> Started publishing poems online and joined local writing groups.</li>
                    <li><strong>2020:</strong> Published my first poetry collection, "Whispers of Dawn."</li>
                    <li><strong>2024:</strong> Currently working on a new collection and focusing on refining my craft through various poetic forms.</li>

            <h2>My Poetic Influences</h2>
            <div class="about-flap-content">
                <p>I'm inspired by poets like Emily Dickinson and T.S. Eliot, who taught me the beauty of subtlety and metaphor. Their works continue to guide me in my own creative endeavors. I find deep resonance in the romantic and expressive qualities of Keats, the transcendentalism of Whitman, the emotional depth of Sylvia Plath, and the gothic mystique of Poe. These influences shape my own writing, leading me to explore themes of love, loss, and the human condition through rhyme, meter, and symbolism.</p>

            <h2>My Writing Process</h2>
            <div class="about-flap-content">
                <p>Each poem I write is a journey. I often begin with a thought or an emotion that I need to explore. From there, I allow my words to flow naturally, shaping them until they feel right. My work is often grounded in classical structures, but I enjoy pushing the boundaries by blending traditional forms with modern language and themes.</p>
