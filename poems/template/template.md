_Sonnet_  
2024

Upon the rise of light, the shadows flee,  
And whispers soft of dawn caress the air,  
Where morning breaks, and all the world can see,  
The sun ascends, dispelling darkest care.  
In golden hues, the heavens stretch and rise,  
As fleeting night surrenders to the day;  
The dew upon the grass reflects the skies,  
And warmth replaces cold in soft array.  
So let the light of day within me burn,  
And in its glow, all shadows shall return.
